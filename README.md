# [STATE] Immunization Automation

An automated Python script that:
1. Extracts active student roster data from the school district's database
2. Formats it according to state immunization registry requirements
3. Emails the data to DOH staff who upload it to the state immunization tracking system
4. Enables the DOH to match student records with their immunization histories for compliance monitoring
## üéØ Purpose

This application automates the tedious manual process of:
1. **Querying the database** for active student roster data
2. **Generating Excel reports** with immunization compliance information  
3. **Emailing reports** to designated staff members for processing
4. **Automatically handling school year transitions** every September 1st

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üóìÔ∏è Automatic School Year Management
The system's **most important feature** is its automatic school year detection:

- **No manual updates required** - The script automatically calculates the correct school year based on the system date
- **September 1st transitions** - Seamlessly switches to the new school year without intervention
- **Smart date logic**: 
  - Before Sept 1st: Uses previous year (e.g., August 2025 = 2024 school year)
  - On/After Sept 1st: Uses current year (e.g., September 2025 = 2025 school year)

**Example Timeline:**
```
August 31, 2025    ‚Üí School Year 2024 (2024-2025 academic year)
September 1, 2025  ‚Üí School Year 2025 (2025-2026 academic year) 
September 1, 2026  ‚Üí School Year 2026 (2026-2027 academic year)
```

### üîí Secure Configuration
- **Credentials protected** via gitignored `init.py` files
- **Database connections** using SQLAlchemy with connection pooling
- **No hardcoded passwords** or sensitive information in committed code

### üìß Automated Email Distribution  
- **Excel attachments** generated automatically from query results
- **Multiple recipients** supported via configuration
- **Professional email templates** with report details and instructions
- **Portal links** included for easy data processing

### üîÑ Robust Error Handling
- **Database retry logic** for connection failures
- **Comprehensive logging** with rotating log files  
- **Email delivery confirmation** and failure notifications
- **Validation checks** for all critical components

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13+
- Access to database
- Internal SMTP server access

### Installation

1. **Clone and setup environment:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Immunization-Automation
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Configure credentials:**
```bash
cp src/config/init_example.py src/config/init.py
# Edit src/config/init.py with your actual credentials
```

3. **Test the setup:**
```bash
# Test database and email connections
python src/main.py --test-db --test-email

# Test full process without sending email
python src/main.py --dry-run
```

4. **Run the automation:**
```bash
python src/main.py
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Windows Task Scheduler Setup

For automated execution, use the included batch file:

1. **Configure Task Scheduler:**
   - Program/script: `C:\path\to\Immunization-Automation\run_automation.bat`
   - Start in: `C:\path\to\Immunization-Automation`
   - Run with highest privileges: Yes

2. **Schedule frequency:** Set based on your immunization reporting needs

## üìä How the School Year Logic Works

### The Problem This Solves
Previously, the SQL query had a hardcoded year value:
```sql
AND yr.SCHOOL_YEAR = 2025  -- Had to manually update each September!
```

### The Automated Solution
The system now automatically:

1. **Reads the current date** from the system calendar
2. **Calculates the school year** using the September 1st transition rule
3. **Parameterizes the SQL query** to use the calculated year:
```sql
AND yr.SCHOOL_YEAR = :school_year  -- Automatically populated!
```

### School Year Calculation Logic
```python
def get_current_school_year():
    today = datetime.now()
    current_year = today.year
    
    # September 1st is the school year boundary
    school_year_start = datetime(current_year, 9, 1)  # Sept 1st
    
    if today < school_year_start:
        return current_year - 1  # Still in previous school year
    else:
        return current_year      # New school year has begun
```

### Real-World Examples
- **August 31, 2025 at 11:59 PM** ‚Üí Returns `2024` (still in 2024-2025 school year)
- **September 1, 2025 at 12:01 AM** ‚Üí Returns `2025` (new 2025-2026 school year)
- **December 15, 2025** ‚Üí Returns `2025` (continuing 2025-2026 school year)
- **June 30, 2026** ‚Üí Returns `2025` (still in 2025-2026 school year)
- **September 1, 2026** ‚Üí Returns `2026` (new 2026-2027 school year begins)
